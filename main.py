# ☕️ Coffee Order Simulator - Session 3: Data Types and Operators ☕️
# Welcome to Code Café! Let's take your order using Python.
# This session is all about how we can talk to Python (input) and how it talks back (output).


# Print a welcome message
print("Welcome to Code Café!")
print("Let's take your order.\n")
customer_name = input("What is your name? ")
print("\nWhat type of coffee would you like to order ?")
print("Options: Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino, Mocha")
coffee_type = input("Your choice ➡️ ")
print("\nWould you like to add any toppings? 🍫🍦")
print("Options: Whipped Cream, Caramel, Chocolate")
toppings = input("Your choice ➡️ ")
print("\nWould you like to takeaway or dine-in? 🏃‍♂️🍽️")
print("Options: Takeaway, Dine-in")


# Ask for the customer's name


# Ask for coffee type


# Ask for extra toppings


# Ask for takeaway or dine-in


# Print a cute little receipt


# Use sep and end for formatting fun



print("Thank you for ordering from Code Café! 🌈💻")
print("Your coffee will be ready shortly. Enjoy! 🎉\n")

# 💡 Notes for learners:
# - input() lets Python take information from the user.
# - print() displays information back to the user.
# - You can decorate your output using escape characters like \n (new line) and special parameters like end= and sep=
# - datetime module helps you work with real-world time and date
