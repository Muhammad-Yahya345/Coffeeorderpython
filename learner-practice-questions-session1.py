A librarian is writing a program to manage the record of borrowed books and needs
help deciding names for variables that are storing information about the books.

Write a program to declare variables for each of the following values. Use a consistent
naming convention for variables:

- Book's name: Hold On
- Book's unique ID: 123-ABC
- Is the book available for borrowing?: yes
- Borrower's name: John Doe
- Maximum number of borrows allowed: 5 (this value is fixed and does not change)

Which naming convention(s) (i.e. pascal case, snake case, camel case, capital case) are you
using for each variable?
"""

# Declare variable for book's name


# Declare variable for book's unique ID


# Declare variable for whether the book is available


# Declare variable for borrower's name


# Declare variable for maximum borrows
# (note that this value does not change, use appropriate naming convention)


# Which naming convention(s) did you use?

Write a program to declare two variables 'name' and 'hobby' containing your name
and hobby respectively.

Now, add three additional lines to output the message:

    (your name) likes (your hobby)

in three different ways:

- Using comma separated messages in print() e.g. print(x, y, z)
- Using f-strings
- Using .format() method

Which way of outputting is the best in your opinion? Think in terms of code
readability, there's no definite answer!
"""

# Declare 'name' variable containing your name


# Declare 'hobby' variable containing your favorite hobby


# Print values: using comma separated messages in print()


# Print values: using f-string


# Print values: using .format() method


"""
In the previous question, the name and hobby variables contain your name and hobby.
Lets update this program so the user can provide their own name and hobby.

Modify the previous code so that user can input the values for name and hobby variables.
Keep the remaining program (outputting of name and hobby) the same as before.

Use some nice prompts for inputs.
"""

# Declare 'name' variable taking input of user name with prompt


# Declare 'hobby' variable taking input of user favorite hobby with prompt


# Print values in the same way as before

Clark wrote a calculator that takes two numbers and adds them. The code is shown below:

    n1 = input("Enter first number: ")
    n2 = input("Enter second number: ")
    sum = n1 + n2
    print("Sum", sum)

To his surprise, he gets a ridiculous output:

    Enter first number: 10
    Enter second number: 20
    Sum: 1020

What is the problem in his code? Can you fix it?
"""

# Uncomment and make changes to the code to fix the calculator

# n1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
# n2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
# sum = n1 + n2
# print("Sum", sum)

"""
A local superstore requires a bill calculator which takes the unit price (price of single
item) and the number of items that customer has bought and computes the total cost.

Write code for this bill calculator. Remember, prices are not simple integers!

BONUS: Can you modify the program such that 10% tax is added to the final amount?
"""

# Take input for unit price as correct data type.


# Take input for number of items as correct data type.


# Calculate the final cost and store it in a variable.


# Output the final price with a message.


# BONUS: Create new variable containing price with 10% tax addition


# Output the tax-applied price.


"""
Write a program which takes the relevant inputs and calculates the area of a triangle
based on those inputs.

    Area of triangle = (1 / 2) x (base x height)
"""

# Take the required inputs in correct data type


# Calculate the area


# Output area with a message


"""
Traffic police rules state that driver must be 18 or over in age to drive a car.

Write a program that takes the user age as input and prints True if user can drive
a car (or False otherwise).
"""

# Take user age as input


# Create variable containing True or False based on user age
# (use an appropriate logical operator)


# Print the result


"""
For a triangle, the sum of all of its three angles is equal to 180 degrees.

Write a program to take input for three angles of triangle and print True if the sum of
these angles is exactly 180 (that is, it is a valid triangle) and False otherwise.

Assume angles to be integers.

Test your program with following inputs:

- 90, 45, 45: True
- 90, 60, 30: True
- 30, 60, 60: False
"""

# Take input for three angles


# Compute the sum of angles


# Check if the sum is exactly 180


# Output the result
